*ES2020* introduced **BigInt** as a built-in object. **BigInt** enables us to
represent integers with arbitrary precision, allowing us to perform mathematical
operations on large integers [(2)]. This package includes common bigint
functions related to querying **about** numbers, **comparing** numbers,
performing **rounded division**, performing **modulo** operations, **controlling**
**range** of numbers, performing **arithmetic** operations, obtaining **divisors**
of a number (and related operations), getting the number of possible
**arrangements** of a set of objects, performing **geometry**-related
calculations, performing basic **statistical** analysis, and finding various
**statistical means**.

This package is available in *Node.js* and *Web* formats. To use it on the web,
simply use the `extra_bigint` global variable after loading with a `<script>`
tag from the [jsDelivr CDN].
